# QuickFile website

A website for temporarily storing files that will be deleted in chosen time or date.
Let's say sometime you need to share a file to someone or to another device and thats all thus don't need the file to stay on the website after it's downloaded from the other device or at a certain time.
You can set it to allow only a certain IP, to accept all except one, set download limit etc.
